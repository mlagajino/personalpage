	<h1>Hi! I'm Michael Lagajino. Look at me!</h1>
	<img src="web dev.png">
	<p class="intro">Hi everyone, my name is Michael and I'm an aspiring web developer. In my former career I was a Tech Recruiting Coordinator for a major online sports company. After learning more about the creative projects the web and app develpers were working on such as running every teams website and streaming live games on our mobile app, I knew this was the right career change for me.</p>
	<p class="text">My goal is to find a career where I can be creative in the tech industry and show others my products. My alma matter is Baruch College where I graduated with a BA degree in Corporate Communications and I'm trying to find news ways to connect with people through technology. I also happen to be a huge Rick and Morty fan.</p>
