	<p class="intro">Hi everyone, my name is Michael Lagajino and I'm an aspiring web developer. In my former career I was a Tech Recruiting Assistant for a major sports tech company. After learning more about the creative projects our web and app develpers were working on such as running every teams website and streaming live games on our mobile app, I knew this was the right career change for me.</p>
	<p class="text">I'm looking for a career where I can be creative in the tech industry and show others my products. I graduated from Baruch College with a BA degree in Corporate Communications and I'm trying to find news ways to connect with people through technology.</p>
